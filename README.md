# molarmass
A simple python program to calculate the mass of a molecule.

This program calculates the molar mass of an atom if you put in the molecular formule.

EG './molarmass.py C6H12O6' outputs '180.156' (g/mol).

Made by Thijmen Voskuilen (thijmen@thijmer.nl). You can edit, distribute or do anything other you want to do with this program, as long as you leave my credits in it. I would also like to know what you have added if you edit the file, but that isn't necessary.
